README:
fileDemo.jar is a signed jar file, for security reasons.

First, the key "latte" was created like this:

% keytool -alias latte -genkey

I entered info requested for key creation and
selected a password.  The password is: creamy.

To review a summary of the new key, use:

% keytool -list -v

The jar is signed with this command:

% jarsigner fileDemo.jar latte

and you enter the password "creamy".

Whenever the jar file is regenerated, it needs
to be signed again using jarsigner.


Note:  When I did a "which", both jarsigner
and keytool are located in /usr/bin/.
