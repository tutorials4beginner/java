The location of .jnlp files is defined in index.mem4 thusly:

#define JNLPBASE http://java.sun.com/docs/books/javatutorial/onlineonly/JWS/uiswing/components/example-1dot4
#definemacro JNLPLINK <a href="$JNLPBASE/$DEMO_NAME.jnlp">$DEMO_NAME</a>

For conversion notes, see ../NOTYETexample-1dot4/README.

PROBLEMS
--------
DialogDemo has too many inner classes.  Non-auto-closing dialog
doesn't use the L&F decorations.  Non-modal dialog takes too long
to open -- should be prepared in background.  Also see conversion
notes in NOTYETexample-1dot4/README.

FileChooserDemo isn't signed and thus can't be launched with JWS.
Is this OK?

JWSFileChooserDemo uses 2 deprecated APIs -- setNextFocusableComponent
& StringBufferInputStream.  Also, it can overwrite existing files.
Scary!!

TumbleItem:  I forgot the "/" before the ">" on the param tags, which
caused all but the first to be ignored (null).  

General: JWS caches the .jnlp files and doesn't seem to check whether
they're updated.  To get a jnlp file reread, I had to remove the application
from JWS (Application > Remove) and then try the link in the browser
again.
